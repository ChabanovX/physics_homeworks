In some movie cars were dropped from the sky.
What would be the terminal velocities of each car, if they are
performing a free-fall headfirst without tumbling in the air?

\bigbreak Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \rho = 1.007 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} $
    \item $ g = 9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2} $
\end{itemize}

Find:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ v_{terminal} $
\end{itemize}
