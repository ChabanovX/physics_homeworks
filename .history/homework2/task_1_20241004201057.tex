In some movie cars were dropped from the sky.
What would be the terminal velocities of each car, if they are
performing a free-fall headfirst without tumbling in the air?

\bigbreak Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ \rho = 1.007 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3} $
    \item $ g = 9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2} $
\end{itemize}

Find:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ v_{\text{terminal of each car}} $
\end{itemize}


\section*{Solution}

$$F_d = 0.5 \cdot C_d \cdot \rho \cdot v^2 \cdot A$$

/*************  âœ¨ Codeium Command ðŸŒŸ  *************/
$$ \Sigma F = m \cdot a $$
 Newton's Law: The net force $\Sigma F$ on an object is equal to the mass $m$ of the object multiplied by its acceleration $a$.
