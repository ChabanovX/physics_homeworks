Object is rotating. Subjects to gravitational force.


\bigbreak Given: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $  m  = 0.25kg $
    \item $ R = 0.7m $
    \item $ T_{max} = 30N $
    \item $ g = 9.8m/s^2 $
\end{itemize}


\bigbreak Questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the position of the mass on the circular trajectory (exactly) where the string has
    maximum tension at a given constant speed of the mass
    \item What is the maximum speed (m/s, round to 1 decimal place), when the string does not
    break for any position of the object on the whole circle trajectory
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}
\subsubsection*{Maximum tension}
Tension in the string appears because of the 2 forces: $F_{gravit}$ and $F_{centr}$ \\
The forces are constant. The maximum tension is going to appear at the \textbf{lowest point} of the circle.
\textit{Because the forces will point at the same direction.}
