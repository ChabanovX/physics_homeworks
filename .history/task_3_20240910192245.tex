The fisherman on the boat moves up the river. Under the bridge, he drops a bottle into the water.
Half an hour later, the fisherman turns back, moves down the river and finds the bottle 5 km
down the flow from the bridge. What is the speed of the river if the speed of the boat is constant?

\bigbreak Given: \begin{itemize}
    \item $t_{\text{going from bottle}} = 0.5h$
    \item $S_{\text{bottle travelling}} = 5km$
\end{itemize}

Find: \begin{itemize}
    \item $v_{\text{river}}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

A fisherman guy travelled 0.5 hours with the speed $$\Vec{v}_0 = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}$$
Then he turns back (immediately) and started to go back with the speed $$\Vec{v} = \Vec{v}_{\text{river}} + \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}}$$
The distance that he travelled when he was going from the bottle is equal to $$t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}})$$
