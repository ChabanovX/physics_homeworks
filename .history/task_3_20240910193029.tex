The fisherman on the boat moves up the river. Under the bridge, he drops a bottle into the water.
Half an hour later, the fisherman turns back, moves down the river and finds the bottle 5 km
down the flow from the bridge. What is the speed of the river if the speed of the boat is constant?

\bigbreak Given: \begin{itemize}
    \item $t_{\text{going from bottle}} = 0.5h$
    \item $S_{\text{bottle travelling}} = 5km$
\end{itemize}

Find: \begin{itemize}
    \item $v_{\text{river}}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

A fisherman guy travelled 0.5 hours with the speed

$$\Vec{v}_0 = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}$$

Then he turns back (immediately) and started to go back with the speed
\begin{equation}
    \label {eq:1}
    \Vec{v}_1 = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} + \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}
\end{equation}


The distance that he travelled when he was going from the bottle is equal to
$$S_{\text{going from bottle}} = t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}})$$

To reach the bottle again he had to go the same distance he went up the river and also 5km that bottle has travelled already.

$$S = S_{\text{going from bottle}} + S_{\text{bottle travelling}}$$
$$S =  t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}) + 5km$$

So, he has speed $v_1$. Then the time spent going for a bottle back is:
$$t_{\text{going for bottle}} = \frac{S}{v_1}$$

$$t_{\text{going for bottle}} = \frac{S}{v_1}$$
