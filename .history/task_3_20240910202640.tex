The fisherman on the boat moves up the river. Under the bridge, he drops a bottle into the water.
Half an hour later, the fisherman turns back, moves down the river and finds the bottle 5 km
down the flow from the bridge. What is the speed of the river if the speed of the boat is constant?

\bigbreak Given: \begin{itemize}
    \item $t_{\text{going from bottle}} = 0.5h$
    \item $x_{\text{bottle destination}} = 5km$
\end{itemize}

Find: \begin{itemize}
    \item $v_{\text{river}}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution}

A fisherman guy travelled 0.5 hours with the speed

$$\Vec{v}_0 = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}$$

Then he turns back (immediately) and started to go back with the speed
\[
    \Vec{v}_1 = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} + \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}
\]

The distance that he travelled when he was going from the bottle is equal to
$$S_{\text{going from bottle}} = t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}})$$

The distance that the bottle has travelled when the guy was going from it:
$$S_{\text{bottle travelling}} = t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}$$

To reach the bottle again he had to go the same distance he went up the river and also the distance that the bottle travelled.
$$S = S_{\text{going from bottle}} + S_{\text{bottle travelling}}$$

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    S = t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}) + t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}
\end{equation}

With closing speed of
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    \Vec{v}_\text{closing} = \Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} + \Vec{v}_{\text{river}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}
\end{equation}

Let's find the time for which he finnaly caught up with the bottle:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:3}
    t_{\text{going for bottle}} = \frac{S}{\Vec{v}_\text{closing}}
\end{equation}

Substitute equations \eqref{eq:1} and \eqref{eq:2}:
$$t_{\text{going for bottle}} = \frac{t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot (\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}} - \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}) + t_{\text{going from bottle}} \cdot \Vec{v}_{\text{river}}}{\Vec{v}_{\text{boat}}}$$ 
$$ t_{\text{going for bottle}} = t_\text{going from the bottle} $$

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The time of going from the bottle is happened to be the same to the time of going for the bottle back.
So, the whole time
