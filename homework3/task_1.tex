One particular glitch in the Mafia 3 video game resulted in the playerâ€™s character getting launched
into the air after being intermittently stuck inside a motor boat.

\bigbreak Given:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m = 80kg$
    \item $H = 70m$
    \item $x = 0.5m$
\end{itemize}

\bigbreak Find: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k =$ ? (If the guy launch at $H$)
    \item $v_{max}$ = ?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Solution} \subsection*{Finding the stiffness}
To solve the task we must understand the processes behind it.
Potential energy from the compressed spring is converted into kinetic energy,
then into gravitational potential energy. Energy is conserved. 

\bigbreak Energy from the spring: $$ E_{spring} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 $$

\bigbreak Gravitational potential energy at height $H$: $$ E_{gravity} = mgH $$

\bigbreak Energy from the spring converts into gravitational potential energy: 
$$ \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = mgH $$

Solve for k: $$ k = \frac{2mgH}{x^2} = \frac{2* 80 * 9.81 * 70}{0.5^2} \approx \boxed{439,000N/m} $$

\subsection*{Calculating the maximum speed}
The maximum speed is going to be reached at the maximum of the kinetic energy.
It is going to be achieved when potential energy from the spring is fully converted into kinetic energy.

$$ E_{spring} = E_{kinetic} $$
$$ \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{max}^2 $$

Solve for $v_{max}$:
$$ v_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{kx^2}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{439,000 * 0.5^2}{80}} \approx \boxed{37 m/s} $$

\vfill \subsection*{ANSWER}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $439,000N/m$
    \item $37 m/s$
\end{itemize}
